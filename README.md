# Stock-Viz-Analyst-Agent

A minimal demo Python project containing `app_main.py`.

## What this repository contains

- `app_main.py` — demo application (entry point).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- Any dependencies used by `app_main.py` (if it imports external packages). If there is no `requirements.txt`, inspect the file and install any packages it needs.

## Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
``` 

2. Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` exists):

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the demo:

```powershell
streamlit run app_main.py
```

## Notes

- If `app_main.py` prints or opens visual output, run it in an environment where you can view the results.
- If you plan to develop further, consider adding a `requirements.txt` with pinned dependencies and tests.
